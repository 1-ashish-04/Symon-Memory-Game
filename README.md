# Simon Says Game

This is my take on the classic Simon Says memory game. I built it from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to sharpen my core front-end skills like DOM manipulation and game logic.

## 🚀 What's Inside

* **Classic Gameplay:** A simple but addictive recreation of the original game.
* **Progressive Levels:** The game gets tougher with each successful round.
* **Persistent High Score:** I've added a high-score feature that uses your browser's local storage, so your best score is always saved.
* **Clean and Simple UI:** The interface is straightforward and easy to use.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2.  Watch the buttons light up in a sequence.
3.  Click the buttons in the exact same order.
4.  If you get it right, you move on to the next level. If you make a mistake, the game ends.

## 🛠️ Built With
